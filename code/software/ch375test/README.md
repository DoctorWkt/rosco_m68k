## ch375test

This code tests the interface to the CH375 USB block
device by initialising it, reading one block and
writing another block.

At present (end August 2024) there is no actual
working CH375 hardware interface with the `rosco_v2`
board. This code assumes that the CH375 will live
at these I/O addresses:

```
; CH375 I/O addresses
CHDATARD  equ   $FFF001
CHDATAWR  equ   $FFF001
CHCMDWR   equ   $FFF003
```

and will generate an auto-vectored IRQ3 interrupt.
Warren's rewritten `r68k` emulator has a working
emulation of the CH375 device at these addresses.

You can test the code as follows:

 - compile the code to make `ch375test`
 - put this file on an SD card image as the file `ROSCODE1.bin`
 - build the real `rosco_v2` ROM image:
   `../../firmware/rosco_m68k_firmware/rosco_m68k.rom`
 - make a pretend USB disk image of 1,024 bytes of so, e.g.
   `$ cat kmain.c > usb.img`
 - build Warren's `r68k` in `../../tools/r68k`

Putting it all together, run the emulator with the ROM,
the SD card and the USB image:

```
$ r68k -R rosco_m68k.rom -S sdcard.img -U usb.img
```

You will probably need to change the filenames to be
the ones that you have, i.e. add a few `../../` etc.

You should see the following:
